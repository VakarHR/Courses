## Relations and Functions:

1. Assume these two sets: $A={1,2,3,4,5}$ and $B=\{a,b,c\}$. 
    - Define three different relations.
    - How many relations can be defined? $(x,y): x \in A, y \in B$
    - Define three different functions: $f: A \rightarrow B$.
    - How many functions can be defined? $f: A \rightarrow B$.
2. Let $A = \{ Cow, Chicken, Crocus \}$ and $B = \{ Plant, Animal, Bird, Mammal \}$.  Let the relation R from A to B be defined as `is a`.
    - Express R in set-builder notation, in roster notation and in an arrow diagram.
3. Let $A = \{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$, and let R be the relation on A (i.e. from A to A) defined as: `aRb iff a is a divisor of b`.  E.g. the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
    - Express R in set-builder notation, in roster notation and in an arrow diagram.
4. Let M be the set of months of the year 2020.
    - Let $f: M \rightarrow Z$ be the function that outputs the number of days in a given input month.  Represent $f$ using a table and using roster notation. 
    - *Python* Define a dictionary in Python that represents $f$.
    - *Python* Define a function that implements $f$. 
5. Given sets $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and $B=\{a,b,c,d\}$, determine  
    - the number of relations R from A to B and 
    - the number of functions from A to B.

6. Evaluate the following functions at x = 0, x = 1, x = -1, x = 2, x = -2, x = 5, and y = 10.
- $f(x) = 5x - 7$
- $g(x) = 5(x-7)$
- $h(x) = {x^2} - x + 1$
- $j(x) = 3(x+1) - 2$
- $k(x,y) = {(x-1)^2} + {y^2}$
- *Python* Implement these functions using anonymous functions (lambda expressions).
