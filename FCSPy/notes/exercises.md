# Exercises:

## Relations and Functions:

1. Provide solutions for the following problems:
    1. In a resturaunt you have a menue with three starters, five main dishes and four desserts. You want one item from each category. In how many ways you can order your dinner?
    2. You have five different books. In how many ways you can put them in your shelf?
    3. You have five books and there are only three empty positions left in your shelf. In how many ways you can put them in the empty positions of your shelf.
    4. You are in a team with 6 members. There are different tasks, one for each member. In how many ways you can divide tasks among each other? 


2. Let $R = \\{Chines, Mexican, Pizza, Pasta, Fries\\}$ (set of dishes) and $D=\\{Fri,Sat, Sun\\}$ (set of days).
    - *Math* Define a function that specifies what should be prepared for a dinner in a given day.
    - *Python* Implement your function. How did you implement it?
    - *Math* How many possible mappings can you define for your function? 
    - *Python* Implement a code that generates all possible mappings (functions).
    - *Math* Suppose you are asked to serve a five course dinner for only one day, say Sunday. In how many possible orders you can server these dishes?
    - *Python* Impelement a code that generates all possible orders of dishes for one five-course dinner.
    - *Math* Suppose you are asked to serve only 3-course dinner. You can choose which three dishes can be served. How many possible options do you? After your selection, in how many possible ways you can serve?
    - *Python* Implement a code that generates all these possible options (3 dishes out of 5).


3. Assume these two sets: $A=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and $B=\\{a,b,c\\}$. 
    - Define three different relations.
    - How many relations can be defined? $(x,y): x \in A, y \in B$
    - Define three different functions: $f: A \rightarrow B$.
    - How many functions can be defined? $f: A \rightarrow B$.
4. Let $A = \\{ Cow, Chicken, Crocus \\}$ and $B = \\{ Plant, Animal, Bird, Mammal \\}$.  Let the relation R from A to B be defined as `is a`.
    - Express R in set-builder notation, in roster notation and in an arrow diagram.

5. Let $A = \\{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$, and let R be the relation on A (i.e. from A to A) defined as: `aRb iff a is a divisor of b`.  E.g. the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
    - Express R in set-builder notation, in roster notation and in an arrow diagram.

6. Let M be the set of months of the year 2020.
    - Let $f: M \rightarrow Z$ be the function that outputs the number of days in a given input month.  Represent $f$ using a table and using roster notation. 
    - *Python* Define a dictionary in Python that represents $f$.
    - *Python* Define a function that implements $f$. 

7. Given sets $A=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and $B=\\{a,b,c,d\\}$, determine  
    - *Python* Implement a program that generates all possible relations.
    - *Python* Implement a code that generates all possible functions.
    - the number of relations R from A to B and 
    - the number of functions from A to B.

8. Evaluate the following functions at x = 0, x = 1, x = -1, x = 2, x = -2, x = 5, and y = 10.
    - $f(x) = 5x - 7$
    - $g(x) = 5(x-7)$
    - $h(x) = {x^2} - x + 1$
    - $j(x) = 3(x+1) - 2$
    - $k(x,y) = {(x-1)^2} + {y^2}$
    - *Python* Implement these functions using anonymous functions (lambda expressions).

9. Which one is a function?
    - ${x^2}+{y^2}=4$
    - $\\{(2,4),(3,9),(4,1),(1,4)\\}$
    - $\\{(2,4),(3,9),(4,1),(2,5)\\}$
    - $y=\frac{(1-{x^2})}{(y-2)}$

10. Given the following equations:
    - $2n + 6p = 12$, express $p$ as a function of $n$ (i.e. $p = f(n)$), and also express $n$ as a function of $p$. 
    - $x + 4y = 3x - y$, express $x$ as a function of $y$, and express $y$ as a function of $x$.
