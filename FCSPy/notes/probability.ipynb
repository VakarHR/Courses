    "**Motivation:** Assume we have data of the weather statistics for the last 200 years. Analysing the data we find out that *on average* in July and in a certain city the weather is rainy for 5 days out of 31 days. Suppose there is not much change in the climate. What would be the probability of having a rainy day on 10th of July in the coming year?\n",
    "In this case, we use the past relative frequency of certain event (rainy days) to predict the event in the future. We achive this by using statistical data from a certain events to assign a *numerical value* to the probability of events. Basically, we are emplying [the empirical law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). \n",

    "**Relative Frequency:** Suppose $A$ is a random event. The relative frequency of the event $A$ in $n$ repetitions of the experiment is defined as $f_n(A)=n(A)/n$, where $n(A)$ is the number of times that event $A$ occurred in the $n$ repetitions of the experiment. The relative frequency is a number between 0 and 1 (why?).\n",

    "**Random Process:** A process is a random process if after its occurance one outcome out of all its possible outcomes for sure occures. But, it is impossible to predict with certainty which outcome that will be.\n",

    "**Sample Space:** In theory, the sample space of a random process (or an experiment) is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Event:** Any *subset* of the sample space is called an *event*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability of an Event:** A *probability measure* is simply a function $P$ that assigns a numerical probability to each subset of the sample space. If $S$ is a finite sample space containing all outcomes with equal likelihood and $E$ is an event in $S$, then probability of $E$ will be: $P(E) = |E| / |S|$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, tossing a fair coin can be considered as a random process. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes, i.e. $\\{Head, Tail\\}$. One event can be having a head which is the subset $\\{Head\\}$, and another event can be $\\{Tail\\}$. The probability of having head will be: $P(\\{Head\\}) = \\frac{|\\{Head\\}|}{|\\{Head, Tail\\}|} = \\frac{1}{2}=0.5$.\n",

But, there are some cases that counting is not as simple as tossing a coin. For example, in a survey there are 20 questions with three possible answers for each (yes, no, maybe).
