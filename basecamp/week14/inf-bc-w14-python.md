# Python 14: Higher Oreder Functions.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for Python 14. In Python 14, you will basics of higher order functions in Python.

**Note**: In this phase, it is expected the learner can plan and run required learning process towards the goals of the week: making solutions to the given problems and product(s).

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 

- Free research.

## Path:

### Step: Functions Are First-Class Citizens.

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. understand programs using: functions as parameters, generators and decorators.
```

#### What to learn?

1. Using **BRef-01, Chapter 9** (after section **Functions Are First-Class Citizens**) make a plan for the week to learn basics of higher order functions (HOF).
	- Read proposed book chapter and practice basic steps.

## Exercises:

1. *Functions can be assigned to different variables*. Read the code given below and write down the result of the program:

```python
def f(x):
    return x*x
double = f
print(double(3))

```
2. *Functions can be collected within a structure*. Read the code given below and write down the result of the program:
```python
def f(x):
    return x**2
    
def g(x):
    return x**3
funcs = [f, g]

print(funcs[0](10), funcs[1](10))
```
3. *Functions as arguments to functions*. Read the code given below and write down the result of the program: [todo: map and using lambda for data processing, maybe something from week 6.]

3. *Generators*. Read the code given below. Function `power_n_range` is implementing a generator. It will generate a sequence of `x` to the power of `n` where `x` is between `first` and `last`. Using a `for`-loop, iterate over the elements generated by `power_n_range` with different values for parameters.

```python
def power_n_range(first=0,last=1,n=1):
    for x in range(first,last):
        yield x**n
```
4. *Decorators*. Take the function `power_n_range` from the previous exercise. We would like to decorate the function such that it provides better printing. For example, printing the sequence of `power_n_range(0,3,3)` will result as the following:
```
0^3 = 0
1^3 = 1
2^3 = 8
```
Make the given code complete and experiment with various values.

```python
def pretty_print(func):
#todo: implement the body of this function


#todo: put required syntactic sugar
def power_n_range(first=0,last=1,n=1):
    for x in range(first,last):
        yield x**n

#todo: imlement a for-loop to iterate over generated sequence. Experiment with and without syntactic sugar.
```
## Problems:

1. The idea is to sort a list of strings. Depending on the purpose of the sorting, the criteria of sorting can be different: alphabetically based on the first letter, length of the string, etc. Use the code template below and implement sorting based on the number of vowels (descending) within a string. For example, `fall` will step before `free`.
2. Usually, processing a dataset a regular function holds the values in (main) memory, known as RAM memory, and returns them to the caller. Suppose you need to search for a word within a very large file (100,000,000+ rows). As you have learned before, one usual solution would be to open the file, load all the rows as a list and search the word. This may not be feasible. 
	- Why do you think this may not be feasible? Try to make an experiment. Implement a short code that writes a sring of length 10 in 100,000,000 lines (don't forget newline character). Then in a different code, open the file, read the lines and search for `hello`. Share your experiemnt with your teachers and classmates. *Hint:* First, calculate how much space would you need in your hard disk and make sure you have enough space and **in your program you close the file after writing**. Before trying with 100,000,000 rows test your program with 100 rows.
	- What would be your solution for reading and processing files with large content? *Hint:* Use *generator function*. A generator function doesnâ€™t hold the values in the main memory. It can deliver each row over time as the caller requests them.
